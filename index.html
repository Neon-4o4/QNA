                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> The CPU is the "brain" of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.[1, 2] It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and executes them. The CPU comprises two main sub-units: the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and the Control Unit (CU).
                            <ul>

                                        <li><strong>Instruction Execution:</strong> It carries out the instructions of a computer program.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Arithmetic and Logic Operations:</strong> It performs all mathematical calculations (addition, subtraction) and logical comparisons (greater than, less than) via the ALU.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Control of Operations:</strong> It manages and coordinates the operations of all other components of the computer.</li>

                    <p>A computer is an electronic device that accepts data (input), processes it according to a set of instructions (program), produces results (output), and stores the data and results for future use.</p>
                    <p>The fundamental parts of a computer can be categorized into two main groups: Hardware and Software.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> These are the physical components of the computer system that can be seen and touched. The primary hardware components are:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Input Devices:</strong> Devices used to provide data and control signals to the computer. Examples include a keyboard, mouse, scanner, and microphone.</li>
                                <li><strong>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</strong> The core component that performs most of the processing inside the computer. It consists of the Control Unit (CU) and the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).</li>
                                <li><strong>Memory Unit:</strong> Stores data, instructions, and processing results. It is divided into Primary Memory (RAM, ROM) for active data and Secondary Memory (HDD, SSD) for long-term storage.</li>
                                <li><strong>Output Devices:</strong> Devices used to present the processed data to the user. Examples include a monitor, printer, and speakers.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Software:</strong> This is a set of instructions, data, or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>System Software:</strong> Manages and controls the computer hardware, providing a platform for application software to run. The most important system software is the Operating System (OS).</li>
                                <li><strong>Application Software:</strong> Programs designed for end-users to perform specific tasks, such as word processors, web browsers, and games.</li>

                    <h4>3. What happens when you press the power button on of a computer? / Elaborately explain the steps associated with pressing the power button on of a computer.</h4>
                    <p>Pressing the power button initiates a sequence of events known as the boot process, which takes the computer from an inert state to a fully operational one. The steps are as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Power Supply Initialization:</strong> The Power Supply Unit (PSU) receives power and performs a self-test. If successful, it sends a "power good" signal to the motherboard, supplying stable electricity to all components, including the CPU, RAM, and storage devices.[9, 10]</li>
                        <li><strong>CPU Initialization:</strong> The CPU initializes itself and begins executing a program stored in a non-volatile firmware chip on the motherboard. This firmware is known as BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or its modern successor, UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface).[11]</li>
                        <li><strong>Power-On Self-Test (POST):</strong> The BIOS/UEFI performs a POST, which is a diagnostic test to check that essential hardware components like the CPU, RAM, video card, and keyboard are present and functioning correctly. If an error is detected, the system may halt and issue beep codes or display an error message.[9, 12]</li>
                        <li><strong>Bootloader Loading:</strong> After a successful POST, the BIOS/UEFI searches for a bootable device according to a pre-configured boot order (e.g., SSD, HDD, USB drive). It locates the first sector of the device, which contains the Master Boot Record (MBR) in older systems or the GUID Partition Table (GPT) and EFI System Partition (ESP) in modern systems. This sector contains a small program called the bootloader.[11, 13]</li>
                        <li><strong>Operating System (OS) Kernel Loading:</strong> The bootloader's job is to load the core of the operating system, known as the kernel, from the storage device into the main memory (RAM). For example, Windows uses the Windows Boot Manager, and many Linux distributions use GRUB.[9]</li>
                        <li><strong>OS Initialization:</strong> Once the kernel is loaded into RAM, it takes control of the system. It initializes hardware drivers, mounts the file system, and starts essential system services and background processes (daemons).</li>
                        <li><strong>User Interface Launch:</strong> Finally, the OS starts the user interface, which could be a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI), presenting the user with a login screen or desktop environment. The boot process is now complete.[9]</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4>4. Why are I/O devices necessary for a computer system? List out some I/O devices.</h4>
                    <p>Input/Output (I/O) devices are necessary because they form the bridge between the human user and the computer's central processing unit. Without them, a computer would be an isolated system, unable to receive new information or present the results of its computations.</p>
                    <p>Their necessity can be broken down into two key functions:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Input:</strong> Computers need to receive data and instructions from the outside world to perform any task. Input devices convert human-readable information (like keystrokes or mouse movements) into a machine-readable binary format that the CPU can process.[1, 4]</li>
                        <li><strong>Output:</strong> After processing the data, the computer needs a way to communicate the results back to the user. Output devices convert the computer's binary data back into a human-understandable form, such as text on a screen, printed paper, or sound.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Common I/O Devices:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Input Devices:</strong> Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner, Microphone, Webcam, Touchscreen.</li>
                        <li><strong>Output Devices:</strong> Monitor, Printer, Speakers, Projector, Headphones.</li>
                        <li><strong>Devices that are both Input and Output:</strong> Touchscreen, Network Interface Card (NIC), External Hard Drive.</li>

                    <h4>5. What is FPU? How does it differ from ALU?</h4>
                    <p>An FPU, or Floating-Point Unit, is a specialized part of a computer's processor designed specifically to perform arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers (real numbers with decimal points).[14]</p>
                    <p>The primary difference between an FPU and an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) lies in the type of data they are designed to process [15, 16]:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):</strong> The ALU is a fundamental component of the CPU that handles arithmetic and bitwise logical operations on <strong>integers</strong> (whole numbers) and binary data. Its operations include addition, subtraction, AND, OR, NOT, and bit-shifting.[15] It is a general-purpose calculation unit.</li>
                        <li><strong>FPU (Floating-Point Unit):</strong> The FPU is a specialized co-processor that handles complex mathematical operations on <strong>floating-point numbers</strong>. These operations, such as multiplication, division, and square roots on non-integer values, are crucial for scientific, engineering, and graphics applications. Performing these calculations in a dedicated FPU is significantly faster and more efficient than emulating them in software using the ALU.[14]</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In summary, the ALU handles integer and logical operations, while the FPU handles operations on real numbers (decimals).</p>

If the power is interrupted or turned off, all data stored in it is lost. It is generally used for temporary storage of data that the CPU is actively working on because of its high speed.

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory):</strong> RAM is a form of volatile computer memory that can be read from and written to. It is used by the CPU to store data and program instructions that are currently in use. Because it is volatile, its contents are lost when the computer is turned off. Its "random access" nature means that any byte of memory can be accessed directly without touching the preceding bytes, making it very fast.</li>
                        <li><strong>ROM (Read-Only Memory):</strong> ROM is a type of non-volatile memory from which data can typically only be read, not written to (or written to with difficulty). It is used to store firmware—software that is closely tied to specific hardware and is unlikely to need frequent updates, such as the computer's BIOS or UEFI, which contains the initial instructions for booting the computer.</li>

                    <h4>4. Why is RAM called "Random" Access Memory? How is it different from hard disk? Briefly discuss. / Why RAM is called primary memory? Briefly describe.</h4>
                    <p>RAM is called "Random" Access Memory because any memory location (or address) within it can be accessed directly in a very short and nearly constant amount of time, regardless of its physical position. This is in contrast to sequential access memory (like old magnetic tapes), where data must be read in the order it was stored.</p>
                    <h5>Difference from Hard Disk:</h5>
                    <p>The primary differences between RAM and a hard disk are speed, volatility, and access method.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Speed &amp; Access:</strong> RAM is electronic (solid-state) and allows for direct, random access, making it thousands of times faster than a hard disk. A hard disk is an electromechanical device that involves physically moving read/write heads over spinning magnetic platters, which introduces significant latency (seek time and rotational delay).</li>
                        <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> RAM is volatile, losing its data when power is off. A hard disk is non-volatile, retaining data permanently.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Why RAM is called Primary Memory:</h5>
                    <p>RAM is called primary memory because it is the main working memory of the computer that is directly accessible by the CPU. The CPU can only execute programs and process data that are loaded into primary memory. All data from input devices and secondary storage must be brought into RAM before the CPU can work with it.</p>

                    <h4>5. What is Cache memory? Why is it so fast?</h4>
                    <p>Cache memory is a small, extremely fast, and expensive type of volatile memory that is located between the CPU and the main memory (RAM). Its purpose is to store frequently accessed data and instructions from RAM, allowing the CPU to retrieve them much more quickly than if it had to go to RAM every time.</p>
                    <p>Cache memory is so fast for two main reasons:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Proximity to the CPU:</strong> Cache is physically located closer to the CPU core, often on the same chip. This reduces the physical distance data has to travel, significantly lowering latency compared to accessing the separate RAM chips on the motherboard.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technology Used:</strong> Cache memory is typically built using SRAM (Static RAM) technology. SRAM is much faster than the DRAM (Dynamic RAM) used for main memory because it uses a latching circuit (flip-flops) to store each bit and does not need to be constantly refreshed. DRAM, in contrast, uses a capacitor that leaks charge and must be refreshed thousands of times per second, which slows it down.</li>

                    <h4>6. How does 3-level cache organization work between CPU and main memory? Explain with proper diagram briefly. / Why is cached used? Explain the three level cache organizations between CPU and main memory.</h4>
                    <p>Cache is used to bridge the significant speed gap between the very fast CPU and the relatively slow main memory (RAM). By storing frequently used data closer to the CPU, it reduces the average memory access time and improves overall system performance.</p>
                    <p>A 3-level cache organization is a hierarchy of caches with different sizes and speeds:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Level 1 (L1) Cache:</strong> This is the smallest and fastest cache, located directly on the CPU core. It is often split into an L1 instruction cache (for instructions) and an L1 data cache (for data). When the CPU needs data, it checks the L1 cache first.</li>
                        <li><strong>Level 2 (L2) Cache:</strong> If the data is not found in L1 (an "L1 miss"), the CPU checks the L2 cache. L2 is larger but slightly slower than L1. It can be private to each CPU core or shared between a few cores.</li>
                        <li><strong>Level 3 (L3) Cache:</strong> If the data is not in L2 (an "L2 miss"), the CPU checks the L3 cache. L3 is the largest and slowest of the three caches but is still much faster than RAM. It is typically shared among all cores on a single processor chip.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Process Flow:<br>
                    CPU Request &rarr; Check L1 Cache &rarr; (if miss) Check L2 Cache &rarr; (if miss) Check L3 Cache &rarr; (if miss) Fetch from Main Memory (RAM).<br>
                    When data is fetched from RAM, a copy is placed in all levels of the cache so that subsequent requests for the same data can be served much faster.</p>

                    <h4>7. Describe how data is stored in (i) Hard disk drive, (ii) CD/DVD ROM.</h4>
                    <h5>(i) Hard Disk Drive (HDD):</h5>
                    <p>An HDD is a magnetic storage device. Data is stored on a series of flat, circular platters coated with a magnetic material. These platters spin at high speeds (e.g., 7200 RPM). A read/write head, attached to an actuator arm, moves across the surface of the spinning platters. Data is stored by magnetizing tiny spots on the platters in a specific direction to represent binary 0s and 1s. To read the data, the head detects the magnetic orientation of these spots.</p>
                    <h5>(ii) CD/DVD ROM:</h5>
                    <p>A CD/DVD is an optical storage device. Data is stored as a series of microscopic indentations, called "pits," and flat areas, called "lands," on a reflective polycarbonate layer. This data track spirals outwards from the center of the disc. A low-powered laser beam inside the drive reads the disc. As the disc spins, the laser reflects off the surface. The light reflects differently from a pit than from a land, and a sensor detects these changes in reflectivity, converting them into the binary data of 0s and 1s.</p>

                    <h4>8. Which one is faster- SRAM cell or DRAM cell? Explain with appropriate circuit diagrams.</h4>
                    <p>The SRAM (Static RAM) cell is significantly faster than the DRAM (Dynamic RAM) cell.</p>
                    <p>The reason for the speed difference lies in their fundamental design:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>SRAM Cell:</strong> An SRAM cell uses a flip-flop circuit, typically composed of 6 transistors (6T SRAM), to store a single bit. This circuit acts as a latch, holding its state (0 or 1) as long as power is supplied. It does not require refreshing. Access is very fast because the state can be read directly from the stable latch.</li>
                        <li><strong>DRAM Cell:</strong> A DRAM cell is much simpler, consisting of a single transistor and a single capacitor. The bit is stored as an electrical charge on the capacitor (charged = 1, discharged = 0). Because the capacitor naturally leaks its charge over time, the cell must be periodically read and rewritten (refreshed) hundreds of times per second to retain its data. This refresh cycle, along with the time it takes to charge/discharge the capacitor, makes DRAM slower than SRAM.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Since diagrams cannot be drawn, the circuits are described textually.</p>

                    <h4>9. Draw the block diagram of a 6-transistor SRAM cell.</h4>
                    <p>A 6-transistor (6T) SRAM cell consists of two main parts:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>The Storage Latch:</strong> This is the core of the cell, formed by two cross-coupled CMOS inverters. Each inverter is made of two transistors (a PMOS and an NMOS). These two inverters (total of 4 transistors) form a bistable latch that stores one bit of data (either a 0 or a 1).</li>
                        <li><strong>The Access Transistors:</strong> Two additional NMOS transistors act as switches, connecting the latch to two bit lines (BL and BL-bar). These access transistors are controlled by the word line (WL). When the word line is activated (high), the switches close, allowing the cell to be read from or written to via the bit lines. When the word line is low, the cell is isolated and retains its data.</li>

                    <h4>10. Mention the significance of memory in embedded programming.</h4>
                    <p>Memory is highly significant and a critical constraint in embedded programming for several reasons:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Resource Constraints:</strong> Embedded systems (like those in microwaves, robots, or IoT devices) are often designed with a minimal amount of RAM and ROM to reduce cost, power consumption, and physical size. Programmers must write highly efficient code to fit within these tight memory limits.</li>
                        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Direct memory access is often required for real-time performance. C and C++ are popular in embedded systems because they allow for low-level memory manipulation through pointers, which can be used to directly control hardware registers and peripherals.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> In many embedded applications (e.g., automotive or medical devices), system failure is not an option. Proper memory management is crucial to prevent issues like stack overflows or memory leaks that could crash the system.</li>
                        <li><strong>Memory-Mapped I/O:</strong> In embedded systems, hardware control registers are often mapped directly into the memory address space. Programming involves reading from and writing to specific memory addresses to configure and control hardware components like sensors and motors.</li>

                    <h4>6. Why computer uses binary number system instead of decimal? Explain.</h4>
                    <p>Computers use the binary number system because their fundamental building blocks, transistors, operate most reliably as simple switches. A switch has two stable states: ON or OFF. These two states can be naturally and efficiently represented by the two digits of the binary system: 1 (ON) and 0 (OFF).</p>
                    <p>While it is technically possible to build electronic circuits that can represent ten different states for the decimal system, such circuits would be far more complex, expensive, and susceptible to errors from electrical noise or voltage fluctuations. The simplicity and reliability of the two-state binary system make it the ideal choice for designing and building digital computer hardware.</p>

                        <li><strong>Machine Language:</strong> This is the lowest-level programming language, consisting of binary digits (0s and 1s). It is the only language that a computer's CPU can directly understand and execute. Each instruction in machine language corresponds to a specific operation the CPU can perform. It is extremely difficult for humans to read or write.</li>
                        <li><strong>Assembly Language:</strong> This is a low-level language that provides a symbolic representation of machine language instructions. It uses mnemonics (short, English-like words) like MOV, ADD, SUB to represent machine code operations, making it more readable than binary. An assembler program is required to translate assembly code into machine code. While easier than machine language, it is still hardware-dependent and requires a deep understanding of the computer's architecture.</li>

                        <li><strong>Lack of Control Structures:</strong> High-level languages provide built-in constructs like if-else, for, and while loops. In assembly, these must be manually constructed using conditional jumps (JMP, JE) and labels, which is tedious and error-prone for complex logic.</li>
                        <li><strong>Manual Resource Management:</strong> The programmer must manually manage CPU registers, memory allocation, and the call stack. This adds a significant layer of complexity compared to high-level languages where the compiler or runtime handles these details.</li>
                        <li><strong>Verbosity:</strong> A single, simple operation in a high-level language (e.g., c = a + b) can translate into multiple lines of assembly code (load a into a register, load b into another, add them, store the result). This verbosity makes the overall program structure for complex logic very difficult to follow.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Data Structures:</strong> High-level languages have built-in support for complex data structures like arrays, structs, and objects. In assembly, these must be implemented from scratch using basic memory addressing.</li>

                    <h4>4. "C is a mid level language". Explain.</h4>
                    <p>C is often called a middle-level language because it bridges the gap between high-level and low-level languages. It provides features of both, offering a unique balance of power and abstraction.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>High-Level Features:</strong> C includes high-level constructs that make programming easier and more structured, such as functions, loops (for, while), decision-making statements (if, switch), and data structures (struct).</li>
                        <li><strong>Low-Level Features:</strong> C also provides direct access to the system's memory through pointers. It allows for pointer arithmetic, bitwise manipulation, and direct interaction with hardware addresses. These are features typically found in low-level languages like assembly and are essential for system programming, driver development, and embedded systems.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This combination allows programmers to write efficient, high-performance code with fine-grained control over hardware, while still benefiting from the readability and structure of a high-level language.</p>

                    <h4>5. What are the parameters for choosing a programming language?</h4>
                    <p>The choice of a programming language for a project depends on several critical parameters:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Problem Domain:</strong> The nature of the application is paramount. For web development, languages like JavaScript or Python are common. For scientific computing, Fortran or Python with libraries like NumPy are used. For systems programming, C or C++ is preferred.</li>
                        <li><strong>Performance Requirements:</strong> If the application requires high speed and efficiency (e.g., game engines, operating systems), languages like C++ or Rust are chosen. For applications where development speed is more critical, interpreted languages like Python or Ruby may be better.</li>
                        <li><strong>Platform/Target Environment:</strong> The language must be compatible with the target operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) or hardware (e.g., embedded microcontrollers).</li>
                        <li><strong>Ecosystem and Libraries:</strong> The availability of robust libraries, frameworks, and tools can significantly speed up development.</li>
                        <li><strong>Developer Expertise and Team Skills:</strong> The team's familiarity with a language is a major factor in productivity and code quality.</li>
                        <li><strong>Scalability and Maintainability:</strong> The language should support writing code that is easy to maintain, debug, and scale as the project grows.</li>
                        <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> A large and active community ensures better documentation, help with problem-solving, and a steady supply of updated tools.</li>

                    <h4>2. Distinguish between Source code &amp; Object code. / Define source code and object code. / What is a source Program? An object program? Why are these concepts important?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Source Code (Source Program):</strong> This is the program code written by a human programmer in a high-level or assembly language. It is human-readable and consists of text, instructions, and comments. For example, a .c file contains source code.</li>
                        <li><strong>Object Code (Object Program):</strong> This is the machine-readable code produced by a compiler or an assembler after translating the source code. It consists of binary or low-level instructions that the CPU can understand. It is not easily readable by humans. For example, a .o or .obj file contains object code.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Importance:<br>
                    These concepts are fundamental to the process of software development. The distinction represents the translation from a human-friendly abstraction (source code) to a machine-executable reality (object code). This separation allows programmers to work in powerful, abstract languages without needing to know the intricate details of the underlying hardware. The object code is what is ultimately linked with libraries to create a final executable program.</p>

                    <h4>3. What is compiler? Explain the front-end and back-end phases of compiler in brief.</h4>
                    <p>A compiler is a special program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language (like C++ or Java) into a lower-level language (like assembly or machine code), creating an executable program.</p>
                    <p>The compilation process is broadly divided into two main phases:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Front-End (Analysis Phase):</strong> This phase deals with the source language. It reads the source code, checks it for syntactic and semantic correctness, and generates an intermediate representation (IR) of the code. It is independent of the target machine. Its main stages are:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Lexical Analysis:</strong> Breaks the source code into a stream of tokens (keywords, identifiers, etc.).</li>
                                <li><strong>Syntax Analysis (Parsing):</strong> Checks if the tokens form a valid sequence according to the language's grammar and builds a parse tree.</li>
                                <li><strong>Semantic Analysis:</strong> Checks for logical errors, such as type mismatches.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Back-End (Synthesis Phase):</strong> This phase takes the intermediate representation from the front-end and generates the target machine code. It is dependent on the target machine's architecture. Its main stages are:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Code Optimization:</strong> Improves the intermediate code to make the final program faster and more memory-efficient.</li>
                                <li><strong>Code Generation:</strong> Translates the optimized intermediate code into the target machine language.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                <article>
                    <h4>4. "Interpreter is a program that can execute high level language programs directly." Explain this statement.</h4>
                    <p>This statement is a common simplification. An interpreter does not allow the hardware to execute high-level language programs "directly." The CPU can only execute machine code.</p>
                    <p>What the statement means is that an interpreter <strong>interleaves translation and execution</strong>, giving the appearance of direct execution. The process is as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The interpreter, which is itself an executable program, reads one line or statement of the high-level source code.</li>
                        <li>It analyzes that line and translates it into the corresponding machine code instructions.</li>
                        <li>It immediately executes those machine code instructions.</li>
                        <li>It then moves to the next line of the source code and repeats the process.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>So, unlike a compiler which creates a separate executable file, the interpreter acts as a runtime environment that processes the source code on-the-fly. The user experiences a direct execution model because there is no separate compilation step.</p>

                    <h5>i) Microsoft Windows OS:</h5>
                    <p>Microsoft Windows is a family of proprietary graphical operating systems developed and marketed by Microsoft. It is the most widely used operating system for desktop and laptop computers. Key features include its Graphical User Interface (GUI), which uses windows, icons, and menus, and its broad hardware and software compatibility ("plug and play"). It supports a vast ecosystem of applications, from productivity software to games. Windows is known for its user-friendliness but is a closed-source system, meaning its source code is not publicly available.</p>
                    <h5>ii) Linux OS:</h5>
                    <p>Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel. It is developed collaboratively by a global community of programmers. Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility. It is distributed in various forms called "distributions" or "distros" (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian), which bundle the kernel with system software and application packages. Linux dominates the server, supercomputer, and mobile (via Android) markets and is a popular choice for developers and technical users due to its powerful command-line interface and open-source nature.</p>

                    <h5>i) Microsoft Windows OS:</h5>
                    <p>(See answer to question 2.i above)</p>
                    <h5>ii) MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System):</h5>
                    <p>MS-DOS was a dominant operating system for personal computers during the 1980s and early 1990s. It is a non-graphical, command-line-based operating system. Users interact with the system by typing commands at a prompt. It is a single-tasking, single-user OS, meaning it can only run one program and serve one user at a time. MS-DOS has a simple architecture and provides basic functions for file management and program execution. While now obsolete as a standalone OS, its command-line interface principles live on in the Windows Command Prompt.</p>

                    <h4>4. Why is LINUX preferable? Give some reasons.</h4>
                    <p>Linux is preferable in many scenarios for several key reasons:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Open Source:</strong> Its source code is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This fosters transparency, collaboration, and rapid innovation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Most Linux distributions and the software available for them are free of charge, making it a highly cost-effective solution.</li>
                        <li><strong>Security:</strong> The Linux architecture, with its robust user privilege model, is inherently more secure than many other operating systems. The open-source nature also means that vulnerabilities are often found and patched very quickly by the community.</li>
                        <li><strong>Stability and Reliability:</strong> Linux is renowned for its stability. It can run for years without needing a reboot, which is why it is the dominant OS for servers and critical infrastructure.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexibility and Customization:</strong> Users can customize almost every aspect of the operating system, from the graphical interface to the kernel itself, to suit their specific needs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Linux is generally lightweight and efficient, often providing better performance than other operating systems on the same hardware, especially on older machines.</li>

                    <h4>5. What are the advantages and disadvantages of MAC operating system?</h4>
                    <p>macOS (formerly OS X) is the proprietary operating system developed by Apple Inc. for its Macintosh line of computers.</p>
                    <h5>Advantages:</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>User Interface and Ease of Use:</strong> macOS is widely praised for its clean, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing graphical user interface (Aqua), which provides a consistent and user-friendly experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ecosystem Integration:</strong> It offers seamless integration with other Apple devices like the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch through features like Handoff, AirDrop, and iCloud.</li>
                        <li><strong>Security:</strong> It is built on a stable and secure Unix-like foundation (BSD) and is generally considered less prone to malware and viruses compared to Windows, partly due to its smaller market share.</li>
                        <li><strong>Software and Hardware Optimization:</strong> Since Apple controls both the hardware and the software, macOS is highly optimized to run efficiently on Mac hardware, leading to excellent performance and battery life.</li>
                        <li><strong>Creative Professional Software:</strong> It is the preferred platform for many creative professionals due to the availability and performance of high-quality software for video editing, graphic design, and music production (e.g., Final Cut Pro, Logic Pro).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h5>Disadvantages:</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Cost and Hardware Exclusivity:</strong> macOS only runs on Apple's expensive Mac hardware. It cannot be legally installed on non-Apple PCs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Hardware Customization:</strong> Unlike PCs, Macs offer very limited options for hardware upgrades and customization.</li>
                        <li><strong>Smaller Software Library:</strong> While it has all major applications, its overall software library, especially for specialized business software and games, is smaller than that of Windows.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Keyword:</strong> A keyword is a reserved word that has a predefined meaning and purpose in the C language. These words cannot be used as variable names or identifiers. Examples include int, if, else, while, return.</li>
                        <li><strong>Identifier:</strong> An identifier is a user-defined name given to a variable, function, structure, or other programming entity. It is used to uniquely identify that entity in the program.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Rules for Naming Identifiers:</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>An identifier can only contain alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and the underscore character (_).</li>
                        <li>The first character of an identifier must be an alphabet (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_). It cannot start with a digit.</li>
                        <li>Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.</li>
                        <li>Identifiers are case-sensitive (e.g., myVar and myvar are different).</li>
                        <li>There is no rule on the length of an identifier, but only the first 31 characters are significant to some compilers.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h5>Validation of given identifiers:</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>mte: <strong>Valid</strong>. Starts with a letter, contains only letters.</li>
                        <li>mte16: <strong>Valid</strong>. Starts with a letter, contains letters and digits.</li>
                        <li>@ruet: <strong>Invalid</strong>. Contains a special character (@) which is not allowed.</li>
                        <li>MTE-ruet: <strong>Invalid</strong>. Contains a hyphen (-) which is not allowed.</li>

                    <p>A C token is the smallest individual unit in a C program that is meaningful to the compiler. The C compiler breaks a program down into tokens during the lexical analysis phase.</p>
                    <p>The types of C tokens are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> Reserved words with special meanings (e.g., if, float, for).</li>
                        <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> User-defined names for variables, functions, etc. (e.g., main, age, calculateSum).</li>
                        <li><strong>Constants:</strong> Fixed values that do not change (e.g., 10, 3.14, 'A').</li>
                        <li><strong>String Literals:</strong> A sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes (e.g., "Hello, World!").</li>
                        <li><strong>Operators:</strong> Symbols that perform operations (e.g., +, =, ==, &&).</li>
                        <li><strong>Special Symbols:</strong> Characters with special meanings, like punctuators (e.g., ;, {, }, ()).</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Declaration:</strong> A declaration introduces a variable's name and type to the compiler. It tells the compiler about the existence of a variable but does not allocate memory for it. A declaration is often used when a variable is defined in another file, using the extern keyword. A variable can be declared multiple times.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: extern int count;</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Definition:</strong> A definition is a declaration that also allocates storage space for the variable. It is where the variable is created. A variable can be defined only once in a program. Most simple variable statements are definitions.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: int count; or int count = 10;</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In C, a statement like int x; inside a function is a definition because it allocates memory on the stack. At the file scope, int x; is a "tentative definition" which becomes a full definition if no other definition is found.</p>

                        <li>#define max 52: This is a <strong>preprocessor directive</strong>. Before compilation, the preprocessor scans the code and replaces every occurrence of the token max with the text 52. This is a simple text substitution. #define macros have no data type and do not respect scope rules.</li>
                        <li>const int max = 52;: This is a <strong>variable definition</strong>. It creates a read-only variable named max of type int with the value 52. This variable has a type, exists in memory, and follows standard scope rules (it is only visible within the block it is defined in). Using const is generally preferred in modern C/C++ as it is type-safe and provides better debugging information.</li>

                    <h5>Type Casting:</h5>
                    <p>Type casting is the process of explicitly converting a value from one data type to another. It is done by placing the desired data type in parentheses before the variable or value to be converted. This is often used to force a certain type of arithmetic or to avoid compiler warnings.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong>
                            <pre><code>
int a = 10, b = 4;
float result = (float)a / b; // result will be 2.5
// Without the cast, integer division would occur, and the result would be 2.0
                            </code></pre>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Basic Data Types of C:</h5>
                    <p>(See answer to question 1 in this section for a detailed list and description). The basic types are char (for characters), int (for integers), float (for single-precision floating-point numbers), and double (for double-precision floating-point numbers). These can be modified by qualifiers like short, long, signed, and unsigned.</p>

                    <h4>1. State the limitation of using scanf function for reading strings. How can you overcome it?</h4>
                    <p>The primary limitation of using scanf("%s", str); for reading strings is that it <strong>stops reading at the first whitespace character</strong> (space, tab, or newline). This makes it unsuitable for reading strings that contain spaces, such as a full name or a sentence.</p>
                    <p>This limitation can be overcome in several ways:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Using fgets():</strong> This is the recommended and safest method. fgets(str, size, stdin); reads an entire line of input, including spaces, until a newline character is read or the specified size limit is reached. It also prevents buffer overflows.</li>
                        <li><strong>Using scanf with a modified format specifier:</strong> You can use scanf("%[^\n]s", str);. This tells scanf to read all characters until a newline (\n) is encountered. However, this method is still risky as it does not have built-in protection against buffer overflows.</li>
                    </ol>

                <article>
                    <h4>2. What is the significance of gets and puts function?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>gets(char *str): The purpose of gets() is to read a line of text from the standard input (stdin) and store it in the string str. It reads characters until a newline character is encountered, which is then discarded.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Significance/Warning:</strong> While simple to use, gets() is <strong>extremely dangerous and has been deprecated</strong>. It performs no bounds checking, meaning it will continue to write past the end of the buffer if the input is too long, leading to buffer overflow vulnerabilities. It should <strong>never</strong> be used in modern code.</li>

                    <h4>1. What is binary and unary operator in C? Explain with examples.</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Unary Operator:</strong> A unary operator is an operator that works on a single operand.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>++ (Increment): ++i; (increments the value of i by 1)</li>
                                        <li>-- (Decrement): --i; (decrements the value of i by 1)</li>
                                        <li>- (Unary Minus): -x; (negates the value of x)</li>
                                        <li>! (Logical NOT): !flag; (inverts the boolean value of flag)</li>
                                        <li>sizeof (Sizeof): sizeof(int); (returns the size of the int type)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Binary Operator:</strong> A binary operator is an operator that works on two operands. Most operators in C are binary.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>+ (Addition): a + b;</li>
                                        <li>* (Multiplication): x * y;</li>
                                        <li>> (Greater Than): a > b;</li>
                                        <li>&& (Logical AND): (x > 0) && (y > 0);</li>

                    <h4>2. What is a conditional operator? Can you use conditional operator in place of if...else statement? Show logic behind your answer.</h4>
                    <p>The conditional operator, also known as the ternary operator, is a unique operator in C that takes three operands. Its syntax is:<br>
                    condition? expression_if_true : expression_if_false;</p>
                    <p>Yes, the conditional operator can be used in place of a simple if...else statement, particularly for assignments.</p>
                    <h5>Logic:</h5>
                    <p>The condition is evaluated first.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the condition is true (non-zero), expression_if_true is evaluated, and its result becomes the result of the entire expression.</li>
                        <li>If the condition is false (zero), expression_if_false is evaluated, and its result becomes the result of the entire expression.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Example:</h5>
                    <p>Consider the following if...else statement:</p>
                    <pre><code>
if (x > y) {
    max = x;
} else {
    max = y;
}
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>This is logically equivalent to the following statement using the conditional operator:</p>
                    <pre><code>
max = (x > y)? x : y;
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>Both achieve the same result: assigning the larger of x and y to the variable max.</p>

                    <h4>3. Distinguish between the following terms: ii) and iii) "==" and "=" argument.</h4>
                    <h5>ii) a = i++ (Post-increment) vs. a = ++i (Pre-increment)</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a = i++; (Post-increment): First, the current value of i is assigned to a. <strong>Then</strong>, the value of i is incremented by 1.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: If i is 5, a becomes 5, and i becomes 6.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>a = ++i; (Pre-increment): First, the value of i is incremented by 1. <strong>Then</strong>, the new (incremented) value of i is assigned to a.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: If i is 5, i becomes 6, and a also becomes 6.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <h5>iii) == (Equality Operator) vs. = (Assignment Operator)</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>== (Equality Operator): This is a <strong>comparison</strong> operator. It checks if the values of its two operands are equal. It returns a boolean result: 1 (true) if they are equal, and 0 (false) if they are not.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: if (x == 10) checks if the value of x is equal to 10.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>= (Assignment Operator): This is an <strong>assignment</strong> operator. It assigns the value of the right-hand operand to the left-hand operand.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: x = 10; assigns the value 10 to the variable x.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A common programming error is to use = in a condition where == was intended.</p>

                    <p>Let's trace the execution step-by-step.<br>
                    Initial values: a = 5, b = 6.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>a++;

                                <li>This is a post-increment. The value of a becomes 6.</li>

                        <li>b;
                            <ul>
                                <li>This is a statement with no effect. It simply accesses the value of b and does nothing with it.</li>
                                <li>Current state: a = 6, b = 6.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>This expression has undefined behavior in C because b is modified (b--) and also read (-b) in the same expression without a sequence point. The order of evaluation of (-b) and (b--) is not guaranteed.</li>
                                <li><strong>However, if we assume a common left-to-right evaluation for the terms:</strong>

                                        <li>(-b): The current value of b is 6, so this evaluates to -6.</li>
                                        <li>(b--): This is a post-decrement. The current value of b (which is 6) is used in the expression. After its value is used, b is decremented to 5.</li>
                                        <li>a: The current value of a is 6.</li>
                                        <li>The expression becomes: b = (-6) + (6) + 6;</li>
                                        <li>b = 0 + 6;</li>

                    <h4>1. What is the purpose of the switch statement? How does it differ from the 'if-else' statement?</h4>
                    <p>The purpose of the switch statement is to provide a multi-way branching capability. It allows a program to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a single variable or expression. It serves as a more readable and often more efficient alternative to a long series of if-else if-else statements.</p>

                    <h4>3. Define loop control statements. Is a 'break' required by 'default' case in switch statement? Justify your answer.</h4>
                    <p><strong>Loop control statements</strong> are statements that alter the normal, sequential flow of execution within a loop. They are used to terminate a loop prematurely or to skip an iteration. The main loop control statements in C are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>break: Immediately terminates the innermost loop or switch statement in which it appears.</li>
                        <li>continue: Skips the remaining code in the current iteration of a loop and proceeds to the next iteration.</li>
                        <li>goto: Unconditionally transfers control to a labeled statement (its use is highly discouraged).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>Is break required in the default case?</h5>
                    <p>No, a break statement is not syntactically required for the default case if it is the last case in the switch block.</p>
                    <h5>Justification:</h5>
                    <p>The switch statement executes code until it encounters a break statement or until the end of the switch block is reached. If the default case is the very last one, after its code is executed, control will naturally fall out of the switch block anyway. Therefore, a break is redundant.<br>
                    However, it is considered <strong>good programming practice</strong> to include a break in the default case. This prevents accidental "fall-through" errors if another case is added after the default case in the future.</p>

                    <p>A <strong>while loop</strong> is better when you need to check a condition <em>before</em> performing any action, and it's possible that the action should not be performed at all.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Application:</strong> Reading from a file. You should check if you have reached the end of the file <em>before</em> attempting to read the next line.
                            <pre><code>
while (fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), file) != NULL) {
    // Process the line in the buffer
}

                        <li><strong>Justification:</strong> This pattern is common in situations that require an initial action before a condition can be tested.</li>
                        <li><strong>Application:</strong> A menu-driven program or user input validation. You must first display the menu or prompt for input <em>at least once</em> before you can check if the user wants to exit or if the input is valid.

                    <h4>4. Why 'goto' statement is discouraged to use?</h4>
                    <p>The goto statement is discouraged in modern programming because it promotes the creation of unstructured code, often referred to as "spaghetti code." This leads to several significant problems:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Poor Readability:</strong> goto allows for arbitrary jumps within a function, making the flow of control difficult to follow. This makes the code hard to read and understand.</li>
                        <li><strong>Difficult to Debug:</strong> Tracing the execution path in code with multiple goto statements is a nightmare, making it extremely difficult to find and fix bugs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Maintenance Issues:</strong> Unstructured code is hard to modify or extend without introducing new bugs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Violation of Structured Programming Principles:</strong> Structured programming is based on the principles of sequence, selection (if/switch), and iteration (while/for), which create programs with a clear, predictable, single-entry, single-exit flow. goto breaks this principle.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>While there are very rare, specific cases where goto might be used (e.g., breaking out of deeply nested loops in C), these can almost always be solved with better program design.</p>

                                <li><strong>Scope:</strong> Declared inside a function or a block. They are only accessible within that function/block.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lifetime:</strong> Created when the function/block is entered and destroyed when it is exited.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Actual Arguments (or Arguments):</strong> These are the variables or values that are passed to a function when it is <strong>called</strong>. They are specified within the parentheses of the function call.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Example:</strong> In the call sum(a, b);, a and b are the actual arguments.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Formal Arguments (or Parameters):</strong> These are the variables that are declared in the <strong>function definition</strong> (or prototype). They act as placeholders that receive the values of the actual arguments when the function is called.
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Example:</strong> In the function definition int sum(int x, int y) {... }, x and y are the formal arguments.</li>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When sum(a, b) is called, the value of a is copied into x and the value of b is copied into y.</p>

                    <h4>4. Is it possible to declare two functions with the same name? Write a short note on argument and parameter of a function with appropriate examples.</h4>
                    <p>In the <strong>C programming language</strong>, it is <strong>not possible</strong> to declare two functions with the same name within the same scope. The C language does not support function overloading. Each function must have a unique name.</p>
                    <p>(Note: In C++, it is possible through function overloading, where functions can have the same name as long as their parameter lists are different in type or number.)</p>
                    <h5>Short note on Argument and Parameter:</h5>
                    <p>The terms "argument" and "parameter" are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct meanings in programming.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A <strong>parameter</strong> is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function <strong>definition</strong>. It is a placeholder.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: void printValue(int num) - here, num is the parameter.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>An <strong>argument</strong> is the actual value that is sent to the function when it is <strong>called</strong>.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Example: printValue(10); - here, 10 is the argument.</li>

                    <p>A user-defined function is a block of code written by the programmer to perform a specific, self-contained task. Unlike built-in library functions (like printf or sqrt), user-defined functions are created by the user to modularize their code.</p>
                    <p>Creating functions helps to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Break down a large program into smaller, manageable pieces.</li>
                        <li>Promote code reusability, as the same function can be called multiple times.</li>
                        <li>Improve the readability and maintainability of the code.</li>

                    <h4>6. Define function prototyping with example. Why it is important?</h4>
                    <p>A <strong>function prototype</strong> is a declaration of a function that specifies its name, return type, and the data types of its parameters. It does not contain the function body. It is typically placed at the beginning of a program.</p>
                    <h5>Example:</h5>
                    <pre><code>
#include <stdio.h>

// Function prototype
int add(int a, int b);

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 10); // Function call
    printf("Result: %d\\n", result);
    return 0;
}

// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
                    </code></pre>
                    <h5>Importance of Prototyping:</h5>
                    <p>Function prototyping is crucial because it provides the compiler with information about the function before it is called. This allows the compiler to perform type checking. It can verify that the function is being called with the correct number and types of arguments. If there is a mismatch, the compiler will generate an error or a warning, helping to catch bugs early in the development process. Without a prototype, the compiler might make incorrect assumptions, leading to unexpected runtime errors.</p>

                    <h5>Base Case:</h5>
                    <p>The base case (or terminating condition) is the part of a recursive function that does not make a further recursive call. It is the simplest version of the problem that can be solved directly. A base case is essential to prevent the recursion from continuing indefinitely.</p>
                    <h5>Stack Overflow:</h5>
                    <p>When a function is called, an activation record (containing its local variables, parameters, and return address) is pushed onto the call stack. In recursion, each recursive call pushes a new record onto the stack.</p>
                    <p>A <strong>stack overflow</strong> occurs when the recursive calls are too deep, and the call stack runs out of its allocated memory space. This happens when the recursion does not stop, which is typically caused by one of two things:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Missing Base Case:</strong> The function has no condition to stop calling itself.</li>
                        <li><strong>Incorrect Base Case:</strong> The recursive calls never converge to the base case.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h5>Example: A factorial function without a base case.</h5>
                    <pre><code>
int faultyFactorial(int n) {
    // Missing base case: if (n == 0) return 1;
    return n * faultyFactorial(n - 1);
}

int main() {
    // Calling faultyFactorial(5) will lead to:
    // 5 * faultyFactorial(4)
    // 5 * 4 * faultyFactorial(3)
    //...
    //... * faultyFactorial(0)
    //... * faultyFactorial(-1)
    //... and so on, never stopping.
    // Eventually, the call stack will be exhausted, causing a stack overflow error.

                    <p>An <strong>array</strong> is a data structure that stores a collection of elements of the <strong>same data type</strong> in <strong>contiguous memory locations</strong>. Each element can be accessed directly using its index (or subscript).</p>
                    <h5>Limitations of Array Processing:</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Fixed Size:</strong> The size of an array is fixed at the time of its declaration and cannot be changed during program execution. This can lead to either wastage of memory (if the array is too large) or insufficient space (if it's too small).</li>
                        <li><strong>Homogeneous Data Type:</strong> Arrays can only store elements of the same data type. You cannot store a mix of integers, characters, and floats in a single C array.</li>
                        <li><strong>Costly Insertion and Deletion:</strong> Inserting or deleting an element in the middle of an array is inefficient. It requires shifting all subsequent elements, which is a time-consuming operation, especially for large arrays.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Bound Checking:</strong> C does not perform automatic bounds checking on arrays. Accessing an element outside the array's bounds (e.g., arr[10] in a 10-element array arr[0...9]) leads to undefined behavior and can corrupt memory or crash the program.</li>

                    <h4>2. How 1-D and 2-D array elements are stored in memory? Explain with example.</h4>
                    <h5>1-D Array Storage:</h5>
                    <p>A one-dimensional (1-D) array is stored as a simple linear sequence of elements in contiguous memory locations. If an integer array int arr[4]; starts at memory address 1000, and an int takes 4 bytes, the elements will be stored as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>arr[0] at address 1000</li>
                        <li>arr[1] at address 1004</li>
                        <li>arr[2] at address 1008</li>
                        <li>arr[3] at address 1012</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h5>2-D Array Storage:</h5>
                    <p>A two-dimensional (2-D) array is conceptually a grid or table, but in memory, it is flattened and stored as a contiguous block. C uses row-major order for storage. This means that all elements of the first row are stored first, followed by all elements of the second row, and so on.</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> For int matrix[2][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}}; starting at address 2000:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Row 0:</strong> matrix[0][0] (1) at 2000, matrix[0][1] (2) at 2004, matrix[0][2] (3) at 2008</li>
                        <li><strong>Row 1:</strong> matrix[1][0] (4) at 2012, matrix[1][1] (5) at 2016, matrix[1][2] (6) at 2020</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The entire 2x3 array is stored as a single block of 6 integers.</p>

                    <h4>3. What is the difference between passing an array to a function and passing a single value data item to a function? Explain briefly with examples.</h4>
                    <p>The key difference is that passing a single value uses <strong>call by value</strong>, while passing an array uses <strong>call by reference</strong>.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Passing a Single Value (Call by Value):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A <strong>copy</strong> of the variable's value is passed to the function.</li>
                                <li>The function works on this copy. Any changes made inside the function <strong>do not affect</strong> the original variable in the calling function.</li>
                                <li><strong>Example:</strong>
                                    <pre><code>
void modifyValue(int x) { x = 100; }
int main() {
    int num = 10;
    modifyValue(num);
    // Here, num is still 10.
}
                                    </code></pre>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Passing an Array (Effectively Call by Reference):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>When an array is passed to a function, its name "decays" into a <strong>pointer</strong> to its first element.</li>
                                <li>The function receives the memory address of the array. It does not receive a copy of the entire array.</li>
                                <li>Any changes made to the array elements inside the function <strong>will affect</strong> the original array in the calling function because both refer to the same memory locations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Example:</strong>
                                    <pre><code>
void modifyArray(int arr[]) { arr[0] = 100; }
int main() {
    int myArr[] = {10, 20, 30};
    modifyArray(myArr);
    // Here, myArr[0] is now 100.
}
                                    </code></pre>
                                </li>

                    <h4>5. Define pointer. Write down the disadvantages of it.</h4>
                    <p>A <strong>pointer</strong> is a special type of variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Instead of holding a value like an integer or character, it "points to" the location where a value is stored.</p>
                    <h5>Disadvantages of Pointers:</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Pointers can make code harder to understand and reason about, especially with complex pointer arithmetic or multiple levels of indirection (pointer to a pointer).</li>
                        <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> Improper use of pointers can lead to serious security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, which can be exploited by malicious code.</li>
                        <li><strong>Bugs and Errors:</strong> Pointers are a common source of bugs:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Null Pointer Dereferencing:</strong> Attempting to access the memory location pointed to by a NULL pointer, which causes a program crash.</li>
                                <li><strong>Dangling Pointers:</strong> A pointer that points to a memory location that has already been deallocated (freed). Using it can lead to unpredictable behavior.</li>
                                <li><strong>Memory Leaks:</strong> If memory is allocated dynamically using malloc() and not deallocated using free(), the pointer to that memory may be lost, leading to a memory leak where the memory cannot be reclaimed.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                    <h4>6. What is NULL pointer? Why is it necessary?</h4>
                    <p>A <strong>NULL pointer</strong> is a special pointer value that indicates that the pointer is not pointing to any valid memory address. In C, it is typically defined as (void *)0.</p>
                    <h5>Necessity of NULL Pointers:</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> It is a good practice to initialize pointers to NULL if they are not being assigned a valid memory address immediately. This prevents them from holding a garbage address.</li>
                        <li><strong>Error Checking:</strong> Functions that return pointers (e.g., malloc) can return NULL to signal an error or failure (e.g., memory could not be allocated). The calling code can then check for a NULL return value to handle the error gracefully.</li>
                        <li><strong>Signaling End of Data Structures:</strong> NULL pointers are widely used to mark the end of data structures, such as the next pointer in the last node of a linked list.</li>

                    <h4>7. Illustrate how pointer works? Use necessary figures.</h4>
                    <p>A pointer works by storing a memory address. Let's illustrate this with a conceptual description.</p>
                    <p>Imagine the computer's memory as a series of numbered boxes, where each number is a memory address.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A Regular Variable:
                            <p>When you declare int var = 25;, the computer allocates a box, say at address 1004, and puts the value 25 inside it.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>var (The variable) -> has the value 25</li>
                                <li>&var (Address of var) -> is 1004</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>A Pointer Variable:
                            <p>When you declare int *ptr;, the computer allocates another box for the pointer itself, say at address 2008. This box is meant to hold an address.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Assigning the Address:
                            <p>The statement ptr = &var; takes the address of var (which is 1004) and stores this address inside the box for ptr.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>ptr (The pointer) -> has the value 1004</li>
                                <li>&ptr (Address of ptr) -> is 2008</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Dereferencing:
                            <p>The * operator (dereference or indirection operator) is used to access the value at the address stored in the pointer.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>*ptr means "go to the address stored in ptr (which is 1004) and get the value from that box".</li>
                                <li>So, *ptr evaluates to 25.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Modifying *ptr (e.g., *ptr = 50;) would change the value in the box at address 1004, thus changing the value of var to 50.</p>

                    </ul>
                    <p>The relationship is very close. A string literal like "hello" creates an anonymous, null-terminated character array in memory, and the expression evaluates to a pointer to its first character.</p>
                    <p>Example:<br>
                    char str_array[] = "hello"; // str_array is an array of 6 chars.<br>
                    char *str_ptr = "hello"; // str_ptr is a pointer to the first char 'h' of a string literal stored elsewhere (often in read-only memory).<br>
                    The key difference is that str_array is a mutable array, while str_ptr points to a string literal which should not be modified.</p>

                    <p>A <strong>multi-dimensional array</strong> is an array of arrays. The most common type is a two-dimensional (2-D) array, which can be visualized as a table or grid with rows and columns. It is used to store data that is naturally represented in a tabular format, like matrices or game boards.</p>
                    <h5>Declaration:</h5>
                    <p>A 2-D array is declared by specifying the data type, name, number of rows, and number of columns.<br>
                    data_type array_name[ROWS][COLS];</p>
                    <h5>Initialization:</h5>
                    <p>Multi-dimensional arrays can be initialized at the time of declaration. The initial values are enclosed in braces {}. For a 2-D array, each row's values can be enclosed in their own inner set of braces.</p>
                    <h5>Examples:</h5>
                    <pre><code>
// Method 1: Specifying inner braces for each row (preferred)
int matrix[2][3] = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} };

// Method 2: Without inner braces (less readable)
// The elements are assigned row by row.
int matrix[2][3] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};

// Method 3: Omitting the row count (compiler calculates it)
// The column count must always be specified.
int matrix[][3] = { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} };

                    <p>A union is a user-defined data type in C that allows different types of data to be stored in the same memory location. It creates a single shared memory space that is large enough to hold the largest member of the union. The primary purpose of a union is to save memory when a variable needs to store values of different types at different points in a program, but never at the same time.</p>

                    <p>The C programming language is highly useful and widely adopted for controlling robots and mechatronic systems due to its unique combination of features:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>High Performance:</strong> C compiles to fast, efficient machine code, which is critical for real-time control systems where timing and responsiveness are paramount.</li>
                        <li><strong>Low-Level Memory Access:</strong> C provides pointers, which allow for direct manipulation of memory addresses. This is essential for interfacing with hardware, such as reading sensor data from specific registers or controlling motors by writing to specific memory-mapped I/O ports.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hardware Proximity:</strong> C acts as a "portable assembly language," providing close control over hardware resources without sacrificing the structure and readability of a high-level language.</li>
                        <li><strong>Portability:</strong> C code is highly portable and can be compiled to run on a wide variety of microcontrollers and processors that are the "brains" of robotic systems.</li>
                        <li><strong>Extensive Ecosystem:</strong> C has a mature ecosystem with extensive libraries, compilers, and debuggers available for virtually every embedded platform.</li>

                    <p><em>Since no figure is provided, a general explanation and a sample program to solve a simple system of two linear equations (which is a common result of nodal analysis) are given.</em></p>
                    <p>Nodal analysis in circuit theory typically results in a system of linear equations of the form Ax = B, where x represents the unknown node voltages. To find these voltages, one must solve this system of equations.</p>

                    -1*V1 + 4*V2 = 10<br>
                    The following C program uses Cramer's rule to solve this simple 2x2 system.</p>

                    <h4>6. Suppose you want to develop a project. Then what is the necessity of programming in your projects? Explain briefly.</h4>
                    <p>Programming is essential in modern projects, especially in fields like mechatronics, because it serves as the <strong>"brain" or intelligence</strong> that controls the project's hardware and defines its behavior.</p>
                    <p>The necessity of programming can be summarized as:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Control Logic:</strong> Programming implements the decision-making logic. It tells the project <em>what</em> to do, <em>when</em> to do it, and <em>how</em> to react to different inputs (e.g., "if sensor detects an obstacle, stop the motor").</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Processing:</strong> Projects often rely on collecting data from sensors. Programming is necessary to read this data, interpret it, perform calculations, and filter out noise.</li>
                        <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Programming automates complex or repetitive tasks, enabling a project to operate autonomously without constant human intervention.</li>
                        <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> It provides a way for humans to interact with the project, whether through a screen, buttons, or a remote connection.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> A project's functionality can be drastically changed or updated by simply modifying the software, without needing to redesign the physical hardware.</li>
