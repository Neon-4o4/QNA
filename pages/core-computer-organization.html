      </h4>
      <div class="text-gray-700">
       <p>
        A computer is an electronic device that accepts data (input), processes it according to a set of instructions (program), produces results (output), and stores the data and results for future use.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fundamental parts of a computer can be categorized into two main groups: Hardware and Software.

           <strong>
            Input Devices:

      </h4>
      <div class="text-gray-700">
       <p>
        Pressing the power button initiates a sequence of events known as the boot process, which takes the computer from an inert state to a fully operational one. The steps are as follows:
       </p>
       <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>
         <strong>
          Power Supply Initialization:
         </strong>
         The Power Supply Unit (PSU) receives power and performs a self-test. If successful, it sends a "power good" signal to the motherboard, supplying stable electricity to all components, including the CPU, RAM, and storage devices.[9, 10]
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong>
          CPU Initialization:
         </strong>
         The CPU initializes itself and begins executing a program stored in a non-volatile firmware chip on the motherboard. This firmware is known as BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or its modern successor, UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface).[11]
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong>
          Power-On Self-Test (POST):
         </strong>
         The BIOS/UEFI performs a POST, which is a diagnostic test to check that essential hardware components like the CPU, RAM, video card, and keyboard are present and functioning correctly. If an error is detected, the system may halt and issue beep codes or display an error message.[9, 12]
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong>
          Bootloader Loading:
         </strong>
         After a successful POST, the BIOS/UEFI searches for a bootable device according to a pre-configured boot order (e.g., SSD, HDD, USB drive). It locates the first sector of the device, which contains the Master Boot Record (MBR) in older systems or the GUID Partition Table (GPT) and EFI System Partition (ESP) in modern systems. This sector contains a small program called the bootloader.[11, 13]
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong>
          Operating System (OS) Kernel Loading:
         </strong>
         The bootloader's job is to load the core of the operating system, known as the kernel, from the storage device into the main memory (RAM). For example, Windows uses the Windows Boot Manager, and many Linux distributions use GRUB.[9]
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong>
          OS Initialization:
         </strong>
         Once the kernel is loaded into RAM, it takes control of the system. It initializes hardware drivers, mounts the file system, and starts essential system services and background processes (daemons).
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong>
          User Interface Launch:
         </strong>
         Finally, the OS starts the user interface, which could be a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI), presenting the user with a login screen or desktop environment. The boot process is now complete.[9]

       4. Why are I/O devices necessary for a computer system? List out some I/O devices.
      </h4>
      <div class="text-gray-700">
       <p>
        Input/Output (I/O) devices are necessary because they form the bridge between the human user and the computer's central processing unit. Without them, a computer would be an isolated system, unable to receive new information or present the results of its computations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their necessity can be broken down into two key functions:
       </p>
       <ol class="list-decimal list-inside">
        <li>
         <strong>
          Input:
         </strong>
         Computers need to receive data and instructions from the outside world to perform any task. Input devices convert human-readable information (like keystrokes or mouse movements) into a machine-readable binary format that the CPU can process.[1, 4]
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong>
          Output:
         </strong>
         After processing the data, the computer needs a way to communicate the results back to the user. Output devices convert the computer's binary data back into a human-understandable form, such as text on a screen, printed paper, or sound.

       5. What is FPU? How does it differ from ALU?
      </h4>
      <div class="text-gray-700">
       <p>
        An FPU, or Floating-Point Unit, is a specialized part of a computer's processor designed specifically to perform arithmetic operations on floating-point numbers (real numbers with decimal points).[14]
       </p>
       <p>
        The primary difference between an FPU and an ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) lies in the type of data they are designed to process [15, 16]:
       </p>
       <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
        <li>
         <strong>
          ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):
         </strong>
         The ALU is a fundamental component of the CPU that handles arithmetic and bitwise logical operations on
         <strong>
          integers
         </strong>
         (whole numbers) and binary data. Its operations include addition, subtraction, AND, OR, NOT, and bit-shifting.[15] It is a general-purpose calculation unit.
        </li>
        <li>
         <strong>
          FPU (Floating-Point Unit):
         </strong>
         The FPU is a specialized co-processor that handles complex mathematical operations on
         <strong>
          floating-point numbers
         </strong>
         . These operations, such as multiplication, division, and square roots on non-integer values, are crucial for scientific, engineering, and graphics applications. Performing these calculations in a dedicated FPU is significantly faster and more efficient than emulating them in software using the ALU.[14]
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        In summary, the ALU handles integer and logical operations, while the FPU handles operations on real numbers (decimals).
